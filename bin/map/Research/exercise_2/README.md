## 2. Word Count

Create a class called "WordCount" that uses a Map to store words and the number of times each word appears in a text. Implement the following methods:

- `addWord(String word, Integer count)`: Adds a word to the word count.
- `removeWord(String word)`: Removes a word from the word count if it is present.
- `displayWordCounts()`: Displays all words and their respective counts.
- `findMostFrequentWord()`: Finds the most frequent word in the text and returns the word and its count.
