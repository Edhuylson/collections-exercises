## 1. Event Calendar

Create a class called "EventCalendar" that uses a `Map` to store dates and their respective Events. Each event is represented by an object of the "Event" class, which has attributes such as the event name and the attraction name. Implement the following methods:

- `addEvent(LocalDate date, String name, String attraction)`: Adds an event to the calendar.
- `displayCalendar()`: Displays the event calendar in ascending order of dates.
- `getNextEvent()`: Returns the next upcoming event.
