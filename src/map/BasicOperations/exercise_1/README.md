## 1. Contacts Agenda

Create a class called "ContactsAgenda" that uses a Map to store contacts. Each contact has a name as the key and a phone number as the value. Implement the following methods:

- `addContact(String name, Integer phoneNumber)`: Adds a contact to the agenda, associating the contact's name with the corresponding phone number.
- `removeContact(String name)`: Removes a contact from the agenda, given the contact's name.
- `displayContacts()`: Displays all contacts in the agenda, showing the name and phone number of each contact.
- `searchByName(String name)`: Searches for a contact by name and returns the corresponding phone number.
