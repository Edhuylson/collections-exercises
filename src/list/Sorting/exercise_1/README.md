## 1. Sorting People

Create a class called "PersonSorting" that has a list of objects of type "Person" as an attribute. Each person has attributes such as name, age, and height. Implement the following methods:

   - addPerson(String name, int age, double height): Adds a person to the list.
   - sortByAge(): Sorts the people in the list by age using the Comparable interface.
   - sortByHeight(): Sorts the people in the list by height using a custom Comparator.
