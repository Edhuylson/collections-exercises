## 2. Shopping Cart:

Create a class called "ShoppingCart" that represents an online shopping cart. The cart should be implemented as a list of items. Each item is represented by a class called "Item" that has attributes such as name, price, and quantity. Implement the following methods:

- `addItem(String name, double price, int quantity)`: Adds an item to the cart with the specified name, price, and quantity.
- `removeItem(String name)`: Removes an item from the cart based on its name.
- `calculateTotalValue()`: Calculates and returns the total value of the cart, taking into account the price and quantity of each item.
- `displayItems()`: Displays all the items present in the cart, showing their names, prices, and quantities.
