## 1. Book Catalog

Create a class called "BookCatalog" that has a list of objects of type "Book" as an attribute. Each book has attributes such as title, author, and publication year. Implement the following methods:

- `addBook(String title, String author, int publicationYear)`: Adds a book to the catalog.
- `searchByAuthor(String author)`: Searches for books by an author and returns a list of the found books.
- `searchByYearRange(int startYear, int endYear)`: Searches for books published within a specific range of years and returns a list of the found books.
- `searchByTitle(String title)`: Searches for books by title and returns the first found book.
