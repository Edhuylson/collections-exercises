## 2. Student List

Create a class called "StudentManager" that will handle a list of students. Each student will have attributes such as name, registration number, and grade. Implement the following methods:

- `addStudent(String name, Long registrationNumber, double average)`: Adds a student to the set.
- `removeStudent(long registrationNumber)`: Removes a student from the set based on their registration number if present.
- `displayStudentsByName()`: Displays all students in the set in alphabetical order by name.
- `displayStudentsByGrade()`: Displays all students in the set in ascending order of their grade.
- `displayStudents()`: Displays all students in the set.
